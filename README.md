## About
**winboom** is a minimal program both written in C++ designed to cause a BSOD by raising an exception in ntdll.dll in Windows.

It works in any NT-based system (sorry MS-DOS folks).

## How to use
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since this is really low level stuff, you need to run this program as administrator in order for it to work!

The easy way to use winboom follows like this:
- Go to the **Releases** of this repo.
- Download the latest **winboom.exe** provided.
- Open the file as administrator.
- Click "Yes" in the winboom box.

Now here comes the hard way, if for some reason you want to rebuild this, you can do it.
```sh
cd path\to\winboom
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
And that's it, you have your fresh built **winboom.exe**

It's totally normal because antiviruses are designed to avoid these stuff to happen, but you can temporarily disable it if you really want to run winboom.exe.

<summary>Why did you make this?</summary>

I was heavily bored at my home and with nothing to do, so I remembered that once, a long time ago, I wrote a russian roulette code in Python to BSOD Windows, so I reused that code and translated it to C++.
